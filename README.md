# ML-Project
ML-Project is a project in which I scraped data from yahoo finance and loaded the data into a local MySQL server on my machine. Connection between my python program and the database is done using SQLalchemy.

## Future Plans:
Scrape more meaningful data and load the data into the database using the methods I have already built. Then using the data to train machine learning models using keras and do meaningful data analysis.
